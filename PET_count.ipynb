    "# Introduction\n",
    "We would like to get a rough estimate of the number of research participants for whom brain PET data has been collected yearly for the previous 5 to 10 years, both in the United States and abroad. Getting an estimate of the number of scans collected in the US is fairly straightforward, assuming that the ClinicalTrials.gov data is at least roughly accurate. The tricky part is coming up with an estimate for the number subjects collected worldwide. For that, we use a PubMed search to find all studies related to brain PET and get a ratio of US brain PET studies to non-US brain PET studies and estimate the number of worldwide subjects based on the this ratio in combination with the number of US subjects.\n",

First we'll load in the search results, pull out the start year and completion year, then create an indicator variable for studies funded by the NIH or another US Federal source. "

    "Now that we have the ratio of US to non-US studies from pubmed, we can combine the clinical trials and pubmed data to get an estimate of the number of PET studies per year. First we'll get a count of the total number of subjects in  completed studies each year, along with the number of studies and median number of subjects in each of those studies. Then we'll calculate the number of project non-us studies as the number of US studies from clinical trials multiplied by the ratio of non-US studies to US studies. Then we multiply this number by the median number of subjects per study, to get the projected number of subjects in Non-US Studies. We add this projection to the number of US subjects from clinicaltrials.gov to get the projected total brain PET studies per year. Finally, we multiply this by the approximate size of a single subject's worth of PET data on OpenNeuro.org (300 MB or 0.0003 TB) to get an estimate of the amount of data for brain PET studies generated per year."
